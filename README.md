### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm PaweÅ‚, a computational neuroscientist from ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± **Warsaw, Poland**, currently living in ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª **GÃ¶ttingen, Germany**, where I'm pursuing a PhD degree at SinzLab.
I'm interested in computer vision, pose estimation, neural systems, deep learning, reinforcement learning and many others.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on *pose estimation in rodents*.

I have a blog on [neuroscience and machine learning](https://ppierzc.github.io) and write technical posts about web technologies on [Teacode's blog](https://teacode.io/blog/).
