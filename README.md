### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm PaweÅ‚, a computational neuroscientist from ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± **Warsaw, Poland**, currently living in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **GÃ¶ttingen, Germany**, where I'm pursuing a PhD degree at [SinzLab](https://sinzlab.org).
I'm interested in computer vision, pose estimation, neural systems, deep learning, reinforcement learning and many others.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on *probabilistic models for pose estimation* ðŸ’ƒ.

I write up my ideas and dig deeper into some Machine Learning concepts on [Perceptron.blog](https://perceptron.blog). I sometimes explore some more technical stuff for web technologies on [Teacode's blog](https://teacode.io/author/pawelpierzchlewicz/).
