### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm PaweÅ‚, a computational neuroscientist from ğŸ‡µğŸ‡± **Warsaw, Poland**, currently living in ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª **TÃ¼bingen, Germany**, where I'm pursuing a Masters degree in *Neural Information Processing* at the University of TÃ¼bingen.
I'm interested in reinforcement learning, neural systems, deep learning and many others.

I have a blog on [neuroscience and machine learning](https://ppierzc.github.io)) and post technical posts about web technologies on [Teacode's blog](https://teacode.io/blog/).
